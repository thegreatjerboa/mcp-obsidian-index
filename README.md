# Obsidian Index MCP server

An MCP server that provides a semantic search over an Obsidian vault and exposes recent notes as resources.

## Components

### Resources

The server exposes recently modified notes in your vaults as resources to MCP clients.
- Notes are addressed by an `obsidian://<VAULT_NAME>/<NOTE_PATH>` URL scheme
- Notes have the `text/markdown` media type

### Tools

The server implements one tool:
- `search-notes`: Performs semantic search over indexed notes
  - `query` (required): Search query string
  - `limit` (optional): Max results to return (default: 8)

#### Example Search Result

Each search result returns a compact excerpt with metadata instead of full file content:

# Website Redesign

Planning doc for the company website refresh. Focus on mobile-first
design and improved accessibility. Key stakeholders: Design, Marketing,
Engineering.

## Goals

- Improve mobile experience
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Reduce page load time to under 2s...
```

## Run the server

```bash
uv run obsidian-index mcp --vault <VAULT_PATH> --database <DATABASE_PATH> --reindex --watch
```

- `--vault`: Path to the Obsidian vault (can be specified multiple times)
- `--database`: Path to the local database file (will be created if it doesn't exist)
- `--reindex`: Reindex all notes in the vault (you probably want this every time right now)
- `--watch`: Watch for changes in the vault and update the index accordingly

## Quickstart

  }

## Development

### Building and Publishing

To prepare the package for distribution:

1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:
```bash
uv sync
```

2. Build package distributions:
```bash
uv build
```

This will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.

3. Publish to PyPI:
```bash
uv publish
```

Note: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:
- Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`
- Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`

### Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging
experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).


You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory <PATH_TO_PROJECT> run obsidian-index
```


Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.
